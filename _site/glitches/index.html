<p>As you can see here, our program works fine occasionally even on Windows system. However, sometimes it glitched in a strange way which we could not explain what is happening. Even we used <a href="https://renderdoc.org">RenderDoc</a> for assisting the debugging process, we have no clues how we get the glitch.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we could figure out the reasons causing this before moving on to our next update. :(</p>
