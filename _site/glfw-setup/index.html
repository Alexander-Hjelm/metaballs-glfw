    <p>This is the start of our project. The base code was first written by Alex on his Linux system. He linked all necessary libraries into the repository and created a makefile for program compilation.</p>

<p>We decided to use <a href="https://github.com/glfw/glfw">GLFW</a> as the window managing library and <a href="https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad">GLAD</a> as the OpenGL API loader library. We will also use <a href="https://github.com/g-truc/glm.git">GLM</a> as our maths library.</p>

<p>Here is our first windowed application running:</p>

<p>After testing the program would work on both MacOS and Linux system, we decided to try rendering a simple triangle next. Meanwhile, we can do some project hierarchy cleaning (.gitignore) and constructing our project specification.</p>
