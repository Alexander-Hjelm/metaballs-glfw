title: SPH Implementation
---

Implementing a smoothed particle hydrodynamics from scratch is not easy. So we searched for different open-sourced library to see if it can provide us a fluid simulation. However, most of them require a complex setup or their code structure do not fit into our code. 

We have then considered implementating our own SPH calculation. This includes two papers, [position-based-fluids](http://blog.mmacklin.com/position-based-fluids/) and [SPH fluid simulation](http://rlguy.com/sphfluidsim/). I picked Ryan L. Guy's paper at last.

After plugging in all the fundamental governing equations, the physics simulation works like a charm!

We would call it a huge success, and we probably would end the project right here. If we have the time, we would optimize the SPH calculation a bit more. Perhaps adding a spatial query mechanism for finding the nearest-neighboring particle. Now we would move on to finish our final report. Thank you for reading our development blog till the end.
