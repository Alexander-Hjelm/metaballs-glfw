title: On No... Glitches
---

I tried to add more and more metaballs into the scene. This works on small numbers of metaballs, like below 10. But above 10, we got some flickering effect. And even above 14, our polygonal mesh starts to become very trippy as shown in the second picture.

As you can see here, our program works fine occasionally even on Windows system. However, sometimes it glitched in a strange way which we could not explain what is happening. Even we used [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org) for assisting the debugging process, we have no clues how we get the glitch.

Hopefully, we could figure out the reasons causing this before moving on to our next update. :(
